## The problem

The folks from [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com/) have created [get-css](https://github.com/cssstats/cssstats/tree/master/packages/get-css), a package to get all the CSS from a given webpage. One downside, however, is that it only works for server side rendered applications.

## The solution

This package uses an actual browser under the hood to get all the CSS and exposes an HTTP endpoint that accepts a url to get the CSS from.

## Local testing

I have no idea how local testing for Now is supposed to work, so I created a tiny HTTP server in `dev.js` that calls the actual function that gets deployed.
Run `npm run dev` to run a local version of the function for local testing.

## Optional headers to the destination URL

You can optionally add custom headers to the final URL that this service will navigate through. In order to achieve it you have to add all the custom HTTP headers you want to this service request:

```
GET: https://critical-css-service.now.sh/m/https://my-website.com/

HEADERS:
{
	"X-Custom-Token": "123456"
}
```

## Deployment

Using [Now](https://zeit.co/now): `now`.
